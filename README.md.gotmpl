# ADLS Gen2 Storage

- [HLD](docs/HLD.md)

## Overview

This project allows to provision an ADLS Gen2 `container` on a pre-existing Azure Storage Account. The storage account must have the `Hierarchical namespace` option enabled.
The Terraform configuration files can be found inside the [files](files) folder.

It's a module ready to be used by our OSS [Terraform Specific Provisioner](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-terraform-scaffold).

## Configuring

### Environment variables

To authenticate on Azure using a Service Principal with a Client Secret, the following env variables need to be defined:
- `ARM_CLIENT_ID` - The Client ID of the Service Principal.
- `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` - The Client Secret of the Service Principal.
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - The Subscription ID in which the Storage Account exists.
- `ARM_TENANT_ID` - The Tenant ID in which the Subscription exists.

### Example configuration for the Terraform SP

TODO

To learn more about the configuration parameters, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-terraform-scaffold?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring) of the Terraform Specific Provisioner.

### Terraform State

We recommend to have a different Storage Account where Terraform can save the remote state for this module.

## Deploying

The module is packaged as an **Helm Chart**.
It must be deployed as part of an **Umbrella Chart** along with the Terraform Specific Provisioner and, eventually, other modules.
